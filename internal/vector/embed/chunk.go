// ChunkSpan describes one window into the preprocessed source text.
// CharStart / CharEnd are rune offsets (not byte offsets) into the
// input string passed to ChunkText, so a backend can recover the exact
// substring later for highlighting. Text is that substring, already
// extracted; callers feed Text directly to the embedder.

	Text      string
	CharStart int
	CharEnd   int

// ChunkText splits text into windows of at most maxRunes runes each,
// overlapping by overlapRunes runes between consecutive windows. The
// goal is twofold:
//
//  1. Every span fits inside the embedder's context window. A message
//     longer than maxRunes that would otherwise be truncated (and lose
//     its tail) instead produces multiple spans, each individually
//     embedded.
//  2. A query term that lives near a window boundary can still match.
//     The overlap means a sentence straddling the cut shows up
//     verbatim in both spans, so the ANN search retrieves whichever
//     span scores higher.
//
// When the input fits, ChunkText returns a single span covering the
// whole text. When it doesn't, ChunkText prefers to cut at the last
// paragraph break (\n\n) inside the final 25% of the window, falling
// back to a sentence terminator (". "/"! "/"? "/"\n"), then to a word
// boundary (space), then to a hard rune cut. This avoids slicing the
// embedder's input mid-word, which materially helps recall on prose.
//
// maxRunes <= 0 disables chunking and returns a single span. The
// overlap is clamped so it never exceeds maxRunes/2 — an overlap as
// large as the window itself would loop forever.
//
// maxSpans caps the number of returned spans, dropping tail content
// from any message that would otherwise produce more chunks. <= 0
// disables the cap. The cap exists for a real-world failure mode:
// system-generated error dumps and stack traces can exceed 10 MB of
// body text and would chunk into thousands of spans, blowing past the
// embedder's batch-size assumptions and pushing the whole batch over
// the API timeout. Most callers should pass a generous cap (50–100)
// — enough to cover any legitimate long-form email while keeping
// pathological inputs bounded.
//
// The returned tailDropped is true when ChunkText dropped content past
// the last emitted span — either because the input was first truncated
// by the maxSpans*maxRunes pre-cap, or because the maxSpans cap fired
// inside the main loop while more chunks would otherwise have been
// emitted. Callers use this to mark the message as truncated for
// downstream metrics, regardless of whether the last emitted chunk
// happened to land on a clean soft break (in which case the
// per-chunk Trunc-on-hard-cut signal would not fire).
