# CODEOWNERS - Require approval from repo owners for critical files
#
# This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized changes to:
# - GitHub Actions workflows (could steal secrets)
# - Security review bot scripts
# - Trusted contributors configuration
# - Go module dependencies (supply chain entry point)

# All GitHub Actions workflows and scripts require owner approval
