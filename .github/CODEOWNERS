# CODEOWNERS - Require approval from repo owners for critical files
#
# This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized changes to:
# - GitHub Actions workflows (could steal secrets)
# - Go module dependencies (supply chain entry point)

# All GitHub Actions workflows require owner approval
.github/workflows/** @wesm

# Security-critical configuration
.github/CODEOWNERS @wesm
.github/dependabot.yml @wesm

# Supply chain: Go dependency changes require owner approval
go.mod @wesm
go.sum @wesm
