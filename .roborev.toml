We are using the latest production version of Go.
Please be pragmatic about reviews, raising theoretical or highly
pedantic concerns will result in unnecessary code churn and wasted
review-fix cycles.

The Windows CSV fallback path uses \\N as a NULL sentinel (PostgreSQL
convention) with DuckDB's nullstr option. This is an accepted design
choice — do not flag it as a concern.

HTTP remote defaults, plaintext key display in interactive CLI,
enabled=true override on account creation, and page-aligned pagination
are documented design decisions — see code comments at each site.
