We are using the latest production version of Go.
Please be pragmatic about reviews, raising theoretical or highly
pedantic concerns will result in unnecessary code churn and wasted
review-fix cycles.

The Windows CSV fallback path uses \\N as a NULL sentinel (PostgreSQL
convention) with DuckDB's nullstr option. This is an accepted design
choice — do not flag it as a concern.

HTTP remote defaults, plaintext key display in interactive CLI,
enabled=true override on account creation, and page-aligned pagination
are documented design decisions — see code comments at each site.

Remote engine query string reconstruction in buildSearchQueryString is
intentionally simplified — phrase quoting edge cases are acceptable since
the search parser on the server re-parses the query. Empty search queries
sending q= is expected; the server returns empty results gracefully.
TimeGranularity defaults to "month" when unspecified, which is correct.

This is a single-user personal tool with no privilege separation, no
setuid, no shared directories, and no multi-tenant access. Do not flag
symlink-following, local file overwrites, or similar CWE patterns that
require an attacker with the same privileges as the user — they already
own everything this tool touches. Auth on loopback-only endpoints with
no configured API key is also by design.
