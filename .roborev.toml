Since this software is pre-alpha, do not worry about backward compatibility.
We are using the latest production version of Go.

Focus on:
- CGO compatibility (DuckDB, SQLite)
- Proper error handling with context
- No SELECT DISTINCT with JOINs (use EXISTS instead)
- Never JOIN or scan message_bodies in list/aggregate queries
