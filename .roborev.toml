We are using the latest production version of Go.
Please be pragmatic about reviews, raising theoretical or highly
pedantic concerns will result in unnecessary code churn and wasted
review-fix cycles.

The Windows CSV fallback path uses \\N as a NULL sentinel (PostgreSQL
convention) with DuckDB's nullstr option. This is an accepted design
choice — do not flag it as a concern.

The setup wizard defaults to HTTP (not HTTPS) for remote server URLs.
This is intentional — the deployment model assumes Tailscale or a
trusted LAN where TLS termination is handled at the network layer.
Requiring HTTPS would force certificate management on NAS users for
no security benefit. Do not flag HTTP defaults or allow_insecure as
security issues.

The setup wizard prints the generated API key to stdout. This is
intentional — it is an interactive CLI tool, not a CI pipeline.
The user needs to see the key to use it. Do not flag plaintext key
display in interactive CLI output.

POST /api/v1/accounts forces enabled=true on new accounts. This is
intentional — the endpoint is called by export-token to register
accounts for sync. Creating a disabled account via this flow has no
use case. Do not flag the enabled override.

The remote store pagination uses page-aligned offsets only. All
callers (the API) convert page/page_size to aligned offsets. Non-
aligned offsets are not a supported use case. Do not flag pagination
offset alignment.
